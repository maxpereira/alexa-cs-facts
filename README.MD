# alexa-cs-facts

### What is this?

This is a project based on the Alexa Fact Skill Tutorial (available [here](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/fact-skill-1)). It was created for the December 2017 Alexa Developer Skill Promotion, which is a great program that incentivizes development for the Alexa platform. Check it out [here](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-developer-skill-promotion).

### How do I use it?
This is NodeJS code that can be inputted into AWS Lambda and connected to the Alexa Skills Kit. Follow the above tutorial link and use this code as your Lambda code instead of the sample code they provide. Happy tinkering!

Note: Make sure you change static values such as `GetNewCSFactIntent` to match the name of your own `GetNewFactIntent`.
